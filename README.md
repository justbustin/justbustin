Hey! 

My name is Justin, and I'm a web developer who's learning more about programming everyday. I love exploring new technologies and learning new things! My primary goal as a developer is to further develop my skills, and make everyday life for others just a little bit cooler!

Afterall, it's the buildup of little things that eventually change the world.
